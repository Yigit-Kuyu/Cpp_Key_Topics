// An array is a container data type that stores a sequence of values contiguously
// (meaning each element is placed in an adjacent memory location, with no gaps).

// C++ contains three primary array types: (C-style) arrays,
// the std::vector container class, and the std::array container class.

//  The std::array container class was introduced in C++11 as a direct replacement for C-style arrays.
//  It is more limited than std::vector, but can also be more efficient, especially for smaller arrays.
