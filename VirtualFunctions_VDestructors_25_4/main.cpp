#include <iostream>


// Although C++ provides a default destructor for your classes
// if you do not provide one yourself, it is sometimes the case that you will want to provide your own destructor.

// Rule: Whenever you are dealing with inheritance, you should make any explicit destructors virtual.

class Base
{
public:
    virtual ~Base() // note: virtual
    {
        std::cout << "Calling ~Base()\n";
    }


    // If you don't write "virtual" keyword before class name in destruction (as below), compiler may warn you about the non-virtual destructor.
    // Because we really want the delete function to call Derivedâ€™s destructor and the program looks to see if the Base destructor is virtual.

    /*
       ~Base() // note: not virtual
    {
        std::cout << "Calling ~Base()\n";
    }
    */


};

class Derived: public Base

private:
    int* m_array {};

public:
    Derived(int length)
