## Info

This repository aims to reinforce C++ proficiency by exploring selected topics aligned with the learncpp syllabus. Each C++ file, developed using Code::Blocks 20.03 and C++17, contains information about the respective topic and its source on the [learncpp website](https://www.learncpp.com/). Updates to the folder will be made during my free time.
