#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

// Since std::array and C-style arrays are fixed-size array types,
// std::vector significantly different than most of the other array types: the ability to resize itself after it has been instantiated.
// std::vector is a dynamic array. This mean a dynamic array (also called a resizable array) is an array whose size can be changed after instantiation.


/*
The length vs capacity for a std::vector:
In the context of a std::vector, capacity is how many elements the std::vector has allocated storage for,
and length is how many elements are currently being used.
Note: Most of the time you wonâ€™t need to use the capacity() function.

    // Change the capacity (reallocation) of storage is expensive, avoid unnecessary reallocations.
